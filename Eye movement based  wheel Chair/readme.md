We are using a web camera to capture the eyes for detecting the eye
movements.
For the simplicity, we have designed a small, motorized, wooden
wheelchair model.
A microcontroller is placed on the wheelchair model which is connected
to the motors - driving the wheel chair in the direction the person facing
the camera moves his eyes in.
Both the camera and the wheelchair model is connected to a laptop
through wires. The laptop is where all the programming enabled eye
movement detection and corresponding decision-making is taking place.
